Question: If sequence T is defined for all positive integers n such that t(n +1) = t(n) + n, and t 3 = 14, what is t 24?
Rationale: The sequence T is defined for all positive integers n such that t(n +1) = t(n) + n. This means that t(n +1) = t(n) + n + 1. This means that t(n +2) = t(n) + n + 2. This means that t(n +3) = t(n) + n + 3. This means that t(n +4) = t(n) + n + 4. This means that t(n +5) = t(n) + n + 5. This means that t(n +6) = t(n) + n + 6. This means that t(n +7) =

Question: The difference between simple and compound interest on Rs. 1300 for one year at 10% per annum reckoned half-yearly is?
Rationale: The compound interest is the sum of the simple interest and the interest. So the compound interest is the sum of the simple interest and the interest. The simple interest is the interest on Rs. 1300 for one year at 10% per annum. The interest is the interest on Rs. 1300 for one year at 10% per annum. The interest is Rs. 1300 x 0.10 = 1300 x 0.001 = 1300 x 0.001 = 0.01. The interest is 0.01. The simple interest is 0.01 + 0.10 = 0.11. The simple interest is 0.11. The simple interest is Rs. 1300 x 0.11 = 1300 x 0.01 = 1300. The simple interest is

Question: The “s-number” of a number x is defined as the ones digit of 2^x. Antony rolls a die with 6 sides labeled with the integers from 1 to 6, each of which has an equal probability of landing face-up. He then takes 3^s, where s is the s-number of the result of his die roll, and plots 3^s on a number line as the point A.

Question: If P(x) = ax^4+bx^3+cx^2+dx+e has roots at x = 1, 2, 3, 4 and P(0) = 48, what is P(5)?
Rationale: The equation is P(x) = ax^4+bx^3+cx^2+dx+e. The roots are x = 1, 2, 3, 4. The equation is x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + e = 0. The
equation is x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + e = 0. The equation is x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + e = 0. The equation is x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + e = 0.
The equation is x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + e = 0. The equation is x^4
