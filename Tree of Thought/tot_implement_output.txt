----- Best Rationale for Problem #2 -----
Let's break down each option and the relationships between the variables:
**Example Calculations for Option I (x@y):**
**Problem:**
   * **Option I:** x@y = p² - pq. 
* **Zero as a Result:**  While the question mentions the operation being defined, we can use basic algebraic principles to determine which of the options can be equal to zero. 
   * **Option I (x@y):**  


----- Final Answer for Problem #2 -----
The final answer is **E**. 

**Explanation:**

The rationale provided is incomplete.  To determine which options can be equal to zero, we need to analyze the operations and their relationship to the variables. 

Here's a breakdown of why the answer is E:

* **Option I (x@y):**  x@y = p² - pq.  
* **Option II (xy)@y:**  (xy)@y = (xy)² - (xy)(y)
* **Option III (x)@(x + y):** x@(x + y) = x² - x(x + y) 

**Why E is the correct answer:**

We need to consider the specific values of x and y to determine if any of these options can be equal to zero.  The rationale provided is incomplete and does not explain how to determine the values of x and y that would make any of these options equal to zero.
